According to the code in this file, you will write all the needed test in a file called <name-of-the-component>.test.jsx that you will place in the test folder.
If you have a .md file in the project as a testing guide (see step 1 below) with a recommended structure inside, do like it is written instead.

    !! Important : always refer to the TESTING_GUIDE.md in order to act like an experienced front-end engineer when planning what to test and how to do it the best way !!

2.  Make the plan and show it to me.
    If I have something to say about what you intend to do, modify your plan accordingly and show me again before I tell you to go to the third step.

3.  Write the tests according to your plan.

4.  Run the tests to make sure everything is alright.

5.  If something doesn't work properly, think hard in order to fix it.
